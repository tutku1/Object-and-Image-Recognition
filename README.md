# Object-and-Image-Recognition

"Object Recognition": This project focuses on a deep learning model used for object detection in images, particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained by processing images to identify various objects such as vehicles and animals. The training process enables the model to recognize patterns in pixel data and accurately predict object categories in new images.
